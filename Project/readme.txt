This project is carried out base on the academic purpose 
that we need to understand the ARM microcontroller 
and have ability to design an embedded system application base on ARM architecture.
Audio player is very popular nowadays, especially in entertainment like music players. 
But there are also other applications in industry like: voice announcement in factory, shop; 
voice chat; sound recorder and player; voice processing… 
And market demand for those kind of product still very huge in Viet Nam. 
By understand all those techniques and knowledge, we, as an engineer, 
will be ready for real project similar to this project.
