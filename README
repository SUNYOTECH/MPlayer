	mPlayer Project
*******************************

This project is carried out base on the academic purpose that we need to understand the ARM microcontroller 
and have ability to design an embedded system application base on ARM architecture.

Because audio player is very popular nowadays, especially in entertainment factor, we chose it as a final product to design and implement. Our group had developed new MP3 Player with fully operated functions like other devices in the market.
